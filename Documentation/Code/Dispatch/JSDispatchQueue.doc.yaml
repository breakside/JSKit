        summary: The default queue for background jobs
        description: |
          Background jobs do not block the user interface or main application
          loop.

          This is useful for computationally expensive jobs that would otherwise
          take too much time on the main loop, preventing anything else from
          running.

          While you can create your own queues, the `background` queue is the
          simplest way to get started with dispatched jobs.
