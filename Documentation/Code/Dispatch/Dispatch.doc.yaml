summary: Run background tasks in the UI or on a server
codeURL: Frameworks/Dispatch/
description: |
  Applications will often have a need to run computationally expensive
  operations.  For `UIKit` based applications, an important requirement is to
  never block the user's ability to interact with the application (i.e., never
  cause the UI to hang).  Running an expensive computation on the UI loop is
  therefore unacceptable.  For `ServerKit` based applications, a similar
  requirement exists for the main request handling loop.

  The solution is to run expensive jobs in the background.  `JSDispatchQueue`
  provides an easy and consistent way to invoke background jobs regardless of
  the underlying application type (UI or server).

  Serial Queues
  =============
  Aside from offloading jobs to the background, another common goal is to
  ensure the exact ordering of asynchronous operations.  Serial queues execute
  jobs one at a time in the background regardless of how many are queued up at a
  given time.

  Typically serial queues can be used in situations where you'd otherwise have
  to use a locking mechanism, often leading to simpler and less error-prone
  code.

  `JSDispatchQueue` is a serial queue by default.
