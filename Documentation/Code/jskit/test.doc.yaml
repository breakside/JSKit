  While it is possible to build a `TestKit` project with `make` and then
  run the tests with the resulting commands, the `test` command does this
  all at once.

        summary: Run tests in a headless browser
        description: |
          Tests will by default run in the node environment on the command line, but
          it can be useful to run tests in a browser to verify that everything is
          working correctly in that environment.

          While you can use the `--http-port` option to start an HTTP sever and
          manually run tests in any browser on your computer, that option doesn't
          help with automated testing.

          Testing in a browser via the command line allows you to run tests in
          an HTML environment in an automated way.

          Allowed Values:
          * `chrome`
          * `firefox`
          * `webkit`
        note:
          Browser tests require that you install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev).

          it can be useful to run tests in a browser to verify that everything is

          Using this argument starts a web server and prints out where to go
          in your browser to run the tests.

          Press `ctrl`+`c` to stop the server
