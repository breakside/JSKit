  all at once.

        summary: Start a local HTTP server for running tests in a browser environment
        description: |
          Tests will by default run in the node environment on the command line, but
          it can be useful to run tests in a browser to verify that everything is
          working correctly in that environment.

          Using this argument starts a web server and prints out where to go
          in your browser to run the tests.

          Press `ctrl`+`c` to stop the server
