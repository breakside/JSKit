summary: Create HTML documentation for project code

  Javascript doesn't lend itself to quality code documentation due to its lack
  of strong typing.

  It can also be annoying as a developer to sort through large doc comment
  blocks in code, and a desire to avoid large blocks of documentation in code
  could lead to limited unhelpful documentation.

  Additionally, `JSKit` introduces some features that wouldn't be understood
  by generic javascript documentation engines.

  So `JSKit` has its own documentation format:
  - In separate files from source
  - Uses an easy to write `yaml` markup
  - Allows for `Markdown` syntax in blocks of text
  - Understands `JSKit` concepts

  This `doc` command is what turns the `yaml` documentation into pretty `HTML` 
  files.

  $ npx jskit doc docs/Messages.doc.yaml ~/Desktop/MessagesDocs

        summary: The `.doc.yaml` file that serves as the root of your
          documentation tree

          All documentation must be summarized in a root index.  This is where
          the documentation engine starts as it traverses the documentation
          hierarchy.

        type: String
        summary: The location to output the HTML files
        description: |
          Inside `output-dir` will be a `www/docs` folder that contains
          all of the HTML.

          Also inside `output-dir` will be a `components.json` file that
          contains a JSON list of all the documented components.

          Also inside `output-dir` will be a `components-manifest.json` file 
          that maps html files to their expected URL path (sans-`.html`)
