summary: Initialize an empty `JSKit` workspace
description: |
  Initializes a workspace for a `JSKit` based project.

  Typically for a single application you'll have several `JSKit` based projects
  in one workspace directory.

  For example, if your project is named **Messages**, you might create a
  workspace like this:

  ````
  $ cd ~/Documents
  $ mkdir Messages
  $ cd Messages
  $ npm install --save-dev jskit
  $ npx jskit init
  ````

  Now you can add projects to the workspace with `jskit add`(add):

  ````
  $ npx jskit add framework MessagesKit
  $ npx jskit add html MessagesWeb
  ````

  While the exact organization is entirely up to you, it is generally
  advantageous to keep most non-UI code in a framework (`MessagesKit`) and then
  have a web front end client (`MessagesWeb`) that leverages code from the
  framework. This allows you to reuse the non-UI code for other clients or even
  for server applications.
