summary: Build a `JSKit` based project
codeURL: MakeCommand.js
description: |
  Builds a `JSKit` based project into the `builds` directory.

  Production builds are identified by their project's `JSBundleIdentifier` and
  a timestamp.

  Debug builds are always rebuilt over the same `"debug"` identifier.

  While there is no need to compile code, all `JSKit` based applications are
  collected into a bundle that places code, resources, and bootstrap files
  into a common format intended for distribution and delivery.

  The bundle organization isn't necessarily easy to develop in, so `JSKit`
  allows for a flexible development files organization.

  The build system also does a small amount of work to extract metadata from
  bundled resources, making that metadata available to code in the running
  application.  Web distribution bundles additionally name resources in a
  way to ensure changed files are always downloaded while unchanged files are
  cached forever.

        summary: Additional directory to look for included files and frameworks
        description: |
          `--include` may be specified multiple times to add multiple directories
          to the include search paths.
        note: This should not often be necessary, since `jskit` is designed to
          look in all the expected places related to your project.

        name: --debug
        type: flag
        summary: Build in debug mode
        description: |
          Debug builds do not combine or minify javascript code, allowing for
          debuggers to show exactly the same source files that you develop in,
          making the debug process easier and more straightforward.

        note: Without the `--debug` flag, a production build is assumed, and
          javascript files will be combined and minified
        see:
          - --watch
      -
        name: --watch
        type: flag
        summary: Instead of exiting after a successful build, watch for file
          changes and automatically rebuild
        description: |
          Useful when debugging, the `--watch` flag will keep rebuilding the
          project as you save changes, so you don't even have to think about
          running a new build before running the new code.

        type: String
        summary: The unique build label to use instead of a date-based autogenerated label
        description: |
          Useful if you want to do a build inside a container as the container starts up.

          For HTML builds, it's critical that any containers of the same version
          use the same build label, because the cache-busting http paths of files
          include a component derived from the build label.  Without the same label,
          different containers will be serving different paths for files.
