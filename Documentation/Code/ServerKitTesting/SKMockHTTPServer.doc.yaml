summary: A mock HTTP server that receives requests in memory from an `SKMockURLSession`
description: |
  A mock server doesn't expose any addtional properties or methods over `SKHTTPServer`.

  Typically you'll interface with a mock server via the `server`(SKMockURLSession.server)
  property of a mock session.

  Creating a mock session creates a mock server, but does not configure the server's routes,
  so you'll need to set the `rootRoute` property in order to conduct tests.  Sample
  code is shown under `ServerKitTesting`
