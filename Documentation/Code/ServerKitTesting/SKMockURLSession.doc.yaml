summary: A mock URL session that creates a mock HTTP server for testing
description: |
  When testing `ServerKit` based applications, you can use this `SKMockURLSession`
  to write tests of your server code without actually making HTTP requests over
  the network.

  Typically you'll instantiate a mock session and then set the `rootRoute`(SKHTTPServer.rootRoute) on
  the `server`.

  Then just use the session as you would use any other `JSURLSession`.
