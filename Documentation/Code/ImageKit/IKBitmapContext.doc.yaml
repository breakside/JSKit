summary: A drawing context with a bitmap backing
description: |
  `JSContext` is an abstract drawing API that allows the same code to generate
  graphics in a variety of outputs.

  For example, `UIKit` has its own context for display elements such as
  `UILayer`s.  Or, `PDFKit` has `PDFContext` for drawing to PDF files.

  `IKBitmapContext` is for drawing raster images to a bitmap backing, ultimately
  generating an image such as a PNG.
