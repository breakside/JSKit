summary: A web socket connection between a client and an `SKHTTPServer`
description: |
  `ServerKit` was designed with support for web sockets out the box.

  Typically, your app can provide a web socket service by implementing
  a `SKHTTPWebSocketResponder`, which does most of the work for you.

  This socket interface is what the web socket responder uses to
  communicate with the client.

  Messages
  ========
  Web sockets communicate with "messages" that can either be contined in a
  single chunk of data or be broken across several chunks of data.

  Therefore, this interface has the ability to send a message all at once
  with `sendMessage()`, or it can send chunks at a time with
  `startMessage()` followed by any number of `continueMessage()` calls.

  The structre of your data will determine which method is better suited for
  your use cases.

        description: |
          The web socket specification indicates that a server should send a
          regular ping to the client.

          You should not need to call this method directly because every 
          `SKHTTPWebSocket` schedules and sends a ping automatically.
