summary: Containts the information parsed from a `User-Agent` HTTP header string
description: |
  Allows for easier inspection of user agent properties than simple string matching.

  Per the HTTP specificiation, a `User-Agent` string consists of a series of
  products and comments.  Products take the form of just a `name`() or a
  `name/version`() pair.  Comments are enclosed in parenthesis and separated by
  semicolons.

  While the user agent string can be easily spoofed, the value sent by most
  clients is legitimate, and inspection can help provide an understanding of
  the clients talking to your server.

        description: |
          A user agent string may contain multiple comment sections, each
          enclosed in parenthesis.

          Within each comment are strings seprated by semicolons.

          This list contains all of the semicolon-separated strings found
          in all of the comment sections.
      - name: containsComment
        kind: method
        type: boolean
        summary: Indicates if a given comment is present in the user agent string
        arguments:
          - name: comment
            type: String
            summary: The comment to check for
        note: |
          While this is useful for certain comments that are always the same,
          many comments contain elements such as version numbers that can
          change over time.  Therefore, it can often be more useful to loop
          through all of the `comments` and use `startsWith()`(String.startsWith)
          to see if any comment present has the prefix you're looking for.
