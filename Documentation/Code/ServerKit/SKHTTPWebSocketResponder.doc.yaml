  `ServerKit` was designed with support for web sockets out the box.

  Your app can provide a web socket service by implementing
  a `SKHTPTWebSocketResponder` subclass.

        description: |
          Every websocket needs to support at least one protocol.

          When the client makes the initial websocket upgrade request, it
          provides the protocols it supports.

          The first match between the client and server protocols will be used.

        kind: method
        summary: Called by `SKHTTPServer` when it receives an upgrade request
          for a `"websocket"`.
        description: |
          The default implementation accepts the upgrade and becomes
          the `delegate`(SKHTTPWebSocket.delegate) for the `SKHTTPWebSocket`
          that is created.

          You can override this default behavior if needed, but it may be
          a sign that you should create a different `SKHTTPResponder` subclass.
