summary: A platform for HTTP based server applications
description: |
  `ServerKit` is designed to provide a `Foundation`-based server platform
  that can be used to build organized and performant APIs with the ability to
  share common code with `UIKit` based client-side applications.

  When a `ServerKit` application is bundled, it contains an `SKApplication`
  that runs, typically starting an `SKHTTPServer` to listen for requests.

  HTTP Server
  =======

  When an HTTP request arrive, the `SKHTTPServer` attempts to find a matching
  `SKHTTPRoute`.

  If successful, the `SKHTTPRoute` will instruct the server on which
  `SKHTTPResponderContext` to create and then which `SKHTTPResponder` to call.

  A method on the `SKHTTPResponder` ultimate looks at the `SKHTTPRequest` and
  generates a suitable `SKHTTPResponse`.

  Web Sockets
  ===========
  `ServerKit` has built-in support for WebSocket communication, making it
  easy to implement real-time communication with your front end client.
