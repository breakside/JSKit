summary: Provides a way to access secrets that should not be stored in source code
  and may vary among deployment environments
description: |
  For a given secret name, `SKSecrets` cycles through a list of
  `SKSecretsProvider`s and returns a value from the first provider to match.

  By default a single `SKSecretsEnvironmentProvider` is created, which
  looks for a environmental variable that matches either the secret name or a 
  modified name (captilized with underscores inserted before each camelCap).
