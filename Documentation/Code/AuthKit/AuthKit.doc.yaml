summary: A framework for authenticating end users via OAuth sessions
description: |
  [OAuth](https://oauth.net) is a open standard for authenticating users.

  You can use it in your app to authenticate users using their accounts with
  external services like Google or Microsoft.  This kind of authentication
  can speed up user onboarding because they won't need to create a new login
  or provide their name.
