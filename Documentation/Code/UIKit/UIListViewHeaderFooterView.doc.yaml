summary: A base class for list view headers and footers
description: |
  You can often accomplish a header/footer design with this standard base class,
  which comes with:

  - A `titleLabel`
  - A `detailLabel`

  When combined with a custom `UIListViewStyler`, this base class is often
  sufficient.

  However, you can also subclass `UIListViewHeaderFooterView` to accomplish more
  complicated and sophisticated designs.

        type: dictionary
        summary: A dictionary that a styler can use to store properties
          relating to styling
        description: |
          Often a styler will need to create views or layers to help its
          styling.  Since a single styler is used for multiple cell views,
          the styler can't store those view-specific properties on its own.

          So, `stylerProperties` is a place on each `UIListViewCell` that a styler
          can store cell-specific objects.
