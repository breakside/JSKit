summary: Can represent any kind of user interface event
description: |
  `UIEvent`s are created by low level managers and sent to an application
  via `sendEvent()`(UIApplication.sendEvent).

  From there, events are inspected and routed to the appropriate `UIResponder`,
  which handles the event by updating the UI in some way.

  For example, a mouse down creates a `UIEvent` that ultimate reaches a
  `UIResponder` via its `mouseDown()`(UIResponder.mouseDown) method.

          Most event types except for touch events apply to a single window,
          which can be accessed via this property.

          For events that don't have an associated window or that have
          multiple windows, this will return `null`.

        description: |
          The possible modifier values can be combined with bitwise operators

          For example:

          ````
          var modifiers = UIEvent.Modifier.shift | UIEvent.Modifier.control;
          ````

        summary: The modifiers that are in effect for this event
        description: |
          More than one `Modifier` value can be combined with bitwise operators
          to create a value with multiple modifiers.

          For example:

          ````
          var modifiers = UIEvent.Modifier.shift | UIEvent.Modifier.control;
          ````

          Means that both the shift and control modifiers are pressed.

          Insted of checking this value directly, you should use
          `hasModifier()`, which takes care of performing the bitwise operations
          for you.
      -
        name: hasModifier
        kind: method
        type: boolean
        return: \`true` if the `modifiers` property includes the given modifier,
          \`false` otherwise.
        summary: Check if the given modifier is in effect
        arguments:

            type: Modifier
            summary: The modifier to compare with `modifiers`
        description: |
          This method performs the bitwise operations neccessary to check if
          a single modifier in part of the `modifiers` value.

          It is recommended you use this method rather than perform bitwise
          operations directly on the `modifiers` property.

          For example, a value of `1` indicates the original scale, a value of
          `2` is twice the original scale and a value of `0.5` is half the
