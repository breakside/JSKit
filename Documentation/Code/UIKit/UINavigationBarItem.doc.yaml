summary: An item on a navigation bar

  Navigation bar items are like buttons, but can also be custom controls like
  `UISegmentedControl`.

  For button-like items, `title` and `image` are the most relevant properties.

          View items can be things like search fields or other controls that
          aren't regular buttons.

          If the view is a `UIControl`, which is commonly the case,
          the control will be configured to perform the specified `action`.

          If a specific `target` for the action is not set,
          the action will go to the window's
          `firstResponder`(UIWindow.firstResponder), and iterate through the
          responder chain until a responder handles the action.

          A responder handles an action if it has a method that is named the
          same as the `action`(UINavigationBarItem.action) string.

                  The action name is simply a method name that some

                  If you want the action to go to a specific object, then
                  specify that object in the `target` property.

          If you need a bar item that works differently than a standard
          button, you can specify any `UIView` here and it will be used to
          display the item.

          If you specify a `UIControl` the control's action will be
          automatically setup to call the item's action, so you don't
          have to specify it twice.

          An example of a custom view would be to use a segmented control.
