        name: draggingSessionDidBecomeActive
        summary: Called when a drag session becomes active
        arguments:
          -
            name: session
            type: UIDraggingSession
            summary: The session that became active
        description: |
          Drag sessions are created in an inactive state.  Once the user
          moves their mouse enough, the session becomes active.

          Views can use this call to remember that a drag started and
          handle `mouseUp` differently.

        name: draggingSessionEnded
        summary: Called when the drag ends
        arguments:
          -
            name: session
            type: UIDraggingSession
            summary: The session that ended

            name: operation
            type: UIDragOperation
            summary: The operation that the destination performed
        description: |
          Used by the source to make adjustments after the destination
          performs an operation.

          For example, a `UIDragOperation.move` operation should result in the
          source removing the dragged data.
