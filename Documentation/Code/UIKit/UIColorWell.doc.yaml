  A `UIColorWell` is a button-like control that shows a color and, upon
  activating, either shows the standard `UIColorPanel` or calls a custom-provided
  action.

  Color wells support drag and drop between controls.

          The default styler shows a rectacle (or rounded rectangle or circle
          with `cornerRadius`) of the selected color.  It appears slightly inset
          due to the `wellInnerShadowColor`.

          If a color has an alpha value of < `1`(), the well is divided in half
          diagonally with one half showing the opaque color and the other half
          showing the chosen translucent color.

                          Most controls can determine their intrinsic size by their
                          contents.  For example, a `UIButton` has a title or image
                          that determines its intrinsic size.

                          A color well has no content, so a set size is needed.

                          Adding insets allows the background color to appear around

                          background color can be seen through the translucent half
                          of a well with a selected color that has an alpha value < `1`().

                          Unlike a `UIButtonDefaultStyler`, this color well styler
                          supports different border widths for different states.

                          The default behavior has a translucent black border that
                          changes widths when the well is active or a drop target.

                          Such styling preseves the color preview (compared to a style
                          that darkens the whole control, for example) while still
                          indicating state changes.
