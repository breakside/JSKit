summary: A container for copied data
description: |
  A pasteboard is used anytime data is copied, allowing the data to be pasted
  somewhere else.

  A `general` pasteboard is available for most operations.

  `UIDraggingSession` uses its own pasteboard to manage dragged data without
  affecting the general pasteboard.

  For example, a view that responds to the `"copy"` and `"paste"` actions might
  have an implementation like this:

  ````
  JSClass("StringField", UIView, {

    stringValue: '',

    copy: function(){
      UIPasteboard.general.setStringForType(this.stringValue, UIPasteboard.ContentType.plainText);
    },

    paste: function(){
      if (UIPasteboard.general.containsType(UIPasteboard.ContentType.plainText)){
        this.stringValue = UIPasteboard.general.stringForType(UIPasteboard.ContentType.plainText);
      }
    }

  })
  ````

  Copying Objects
  ===============

  A pasteboard isn't limited to string types.  You can also copy arbitrary
  objects in a similar manner to strings:

  ````
  JSClass("PersonView", UIView, {

    person: '',

    copy: function(){
      UIPasteboard.general.setObjectForType(this.person, "x-myapplication/person");
    },

    paste: function(){
      if (UIPasteboard.general.containsType("x-myapplication/person")){
        this.person = UIPasteboard.general.objectForType("x-myapplication/person");
      }
    }

  });
