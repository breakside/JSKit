                  After calling this method, you must call `updateControl()` on
                  all associated `UISlider` instances.

                  In general, `UIControlStyler`s don't keep track of the controls
                  currently being displayed.  Instead, the stylers rely on the
                  controls themselves to request updates for events like user
                  interaction.

                  In addition, stylers are designed to be static, containing
                  instructions on how to change a control as its state changes.

                  But with this color styler, which is often used in color
                  picker views, it's typically necessary to update the gradient
                  as the user changes *other* sliders.  For exmple, an alpha
                  slider always goes from clear to some hue, but that hue
                  changes as the user adjusts other controls.
