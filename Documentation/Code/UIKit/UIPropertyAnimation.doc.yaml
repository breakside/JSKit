summary: The abstract class for any layer-based animation
description: |
  `UIPropertyAnimation` builds on `UIAnimation` to provide a base for animation
  classes that animate `UILayer` properties.

  `UIBasicAnimation` is the primary subclass used by `UILayer`.

  You typically won't need to create these kind of animation classes directly,
  as they are created implicitly by `UILayer`.

  Higher level animators like `UIViewPropertyAnimator` are easier to use.
