  Buttons are perhaps the most commonly used controls in an application.

  Actions
  =======
  `UIButton` inherits its action API from `UIControl`.

  Using the `addAction()` method, you can use specify an action by name, as is
  typically done for actions that are sent through the `UIResponder` responder
  chain.

  ````
  JSClass("MainViewController", UIViewController, {

    loadView: function(){
      var view = UIView.init();
      var button = UIButton.init();
      button.addAction('test', this);
      view.addSubview(button)
      this.view = view;
    },

    test: function(sender){
      // called when the button is clicked
    }

  });
  ````

  Alternatively, you can provide an anonymous function directly:

  ````
  JSClass("MainViewController", UIViewController, {

    loadView: function(){
      var view = UIView.init();
      var button = UIButton.init();
      button.addAction(function(){
        // called when the button is pressed
      }, this);
      view.addSubview(button)
      this.view = view;
    }
    
  });

        description: |
          The background image can be used to create a decorative edge to the
          button.

          Typically you'll use a stretchable image created by
          `JSImage.stretchableImageWithCapSizes()` so the corners of the
          button won't distort as the button changes size.

          A button can show a different background image for each state.

          For example, it can show a faded image in the `disabled` state,
          and a darkened image in the `active` state.

          Stylers allow for separation between the button's model and its
          presentation.

          One styler can be resused for many buttons,
          reducing the need to subclass `UIButton` just to apply a
          custom style.
