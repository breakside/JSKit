        summary: How to treat images that have thier `renderMode`(JSImage.renderMode)
          set to `automatic`
        description: |
          Images that have their `renderMode`(JSImage.renderMode)
          set to `automatic` should be rendered according to the context
          they're in.

          This `automaticRenderMode` property allows you sepcify the default
          rendering mode for this image view's context.

          For example, an image view that sets `automaticRenderMode` to
          `template` will display images with either `template` or `automatic`
          render modes as template images, but will still display `original`
          images as non-template images in their original form.
