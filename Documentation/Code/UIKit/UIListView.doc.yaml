  A `UIListView` is one of the most versatile componets of `UIKit`, and it
  makes use of several key concepts found throughout `UIKit`.

  Delegate & Data Source
  =========
  The delegate and data source pattern is used often in `UIKit` as a way
  to separate generic control behaviors from an application's specific data.

  In the case of a `UIListView`, the `delegate` and `dataSource` combine to
  1. Populate the list's cells
  2. Respond to user interaction with cells

  Typically, your `delegate` and `dataSource` are the same controller object,
  often a subclass of `UIListViewController`.  Anything that implements the
  `UIListViewDelegate` and `UIListViewDataSource` protocols will do.

  The important delegate methods are:
  1. `cellForListViewAtIndexPath()`, which creates a cell for the list view to
     display.
  2. `listViewDidSelectCellAtIndexPath()`, which is called when a user clicks a
     cell

  The important data source methods are:
  1. `numberOfSectionsInListView()`
  2. `numberOfRowsInListViewSection()`

  which, when combined, tell the list view how many items are included.

  Reusing Cells
  ==========
  Very long lists would cause perforance issues if `UIListView` created a view
  for each cell in the entire list.

  Instead, `UIListView` creates only those cells that are visible in its scroll
  window.  As the user scrolls, cells that become invisible can be reused for
  cells that become visible.

  Typically you'll register cell classes with `registerCellClassForReuseIdentifier()`,
  when creating the list view.

  Then, when the list view calls for `cellForListViewAtIndexPath()`, your
  delegate asks for a reusable cell with `dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier()`,
  which will either return a reusable cell or create a new one if none are
  available for reuse.
