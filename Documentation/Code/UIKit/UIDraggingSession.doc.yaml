summary: Manages information about an drag and drop operation that is underway
description: |
  Drag and drop support makes is really easy for users to move an copy data
  around your app.

  Every `UIView` can act as either a `UIDraggingSource` or a
  `UIDraggingDestination`, meaning each view can provide data for a drag
  operation, or can receive data.

  You'll typically configure a `UIView` to receive drag data via its
  `registerForDraggedTypes()` method.

  Alternatively, if the view is mean to provide data, it will call
  `beginDraggingSessionWithItems()` during `mouseDragged()`.

  In either case, a `UIDraggingSession` is passed around to proivde information
  about the current drag operation.
