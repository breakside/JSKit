summary: A view controller that manages a `UITabView` and automatically
  populates its content from child view controllers
description:
  A `UITabViewController` makes it easy to create a `UITabView` filled with
  content from child view controllers.

  Each child `UIViewController` provides a `tabViewItem`(UIViewController.tabViewItem)
  and a `view`(UIViewController.view) that are used to populate a `UITabView`
  owned by this controller.
