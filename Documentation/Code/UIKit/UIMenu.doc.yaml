                  Often a styler will need to create views or layers to help its
                  styling.  Since a single styler is used for multiple item views,
                  the styler can't store those item-specific properties on its own.

                  So, `stylerProperties` is a place on each `UIMenuItemSeparatorView` that a styler
                  can store item-specific objects.
