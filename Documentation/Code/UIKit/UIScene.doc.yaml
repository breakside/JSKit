summary: Display a collection of related windows all at once

  Typically used to replace one set of windows with another set when a major
  application state change occurrs.

  An example might be an application with two scenes:

  1. Login Scene
  1. Main Scene

  When the application starts, the login scene is displayed.  Then, when the
  user logs in, the login scene is replaced by the main scene.  Finally,
  when the user logs out, all windows are closed and replaced back by the login
  scene.

          Used when preparing a scene:

          var loginWindow = LoginWindow.init();

          var scene = UIScene.init();

          scene.addWindow(loginWindow);
          scene.show();
          ````
        note: Adding a window to a scene will cause its `scene`(UIWindow.scene)
          property to refer back to this scene.
        important: Windows must be added before calling `show()`.  Adding after
          displaying the scene has no effect.
