summary: A layer for displaying images
description: |
  This is the low level layer that `UIImageView` uses to draw images.

  Most of the time, `UIImageView` is what you' should use, but in cases where the
  event overhead of a `UIView` is too much, and you just need text,
  `UIImageLayer` could be appropriate.

          `UIImageView` translates its `scaleMode`(UIImageView.scaleMode)
          into an image frame on this lower level layer.

        summary: How to treat images that have thier `renderMode`(JSImage.renderMode)
          set to `automatic`
        description: |
          Images that have their `renderMode`(JSImage.renderMode)
          set to `automatic` should be rendered according to the context
          they're in.

          This `automaticRenderMode` property allows you sepcify the default
          rendering mode for this image layer's context.

          For example, an image layer that sets `automaticRenderMode` to
          `template` will display images with either `template` or `automatic`
          render modes as template images, but will still display `original`
          images as non-template images in their original form.
