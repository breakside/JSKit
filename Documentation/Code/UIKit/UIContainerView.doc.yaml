summary: A view that automatically arranges a single subview with padding insets or
  alignment
description: |
  Many times a view just needs to layout one subview with some padding insets
  or with an alignment.

  Rather than implement that algorithm by hand each time, `UIContainerView`
  provides a standard way of doing the single child layout with suitable 
  customizability.

                  For an `alignment` set to `full`, the insets represent
                  padding from the containers edges to the subview's edges.

                  For other alignments, the insets affect the area within which
                  the subview will be aligned.

                  Only applicable to `alignment`s other than `full`.

                  While the container view will attempt to use the content view's
                  `intrinsicSize`, and will always size the content view no
                  larger than the container size minus `contentInsets`, you
                  can use `maximumContentSize` to set an additional limit on the
                  content.

                  Width or height values of `0`() indicate no limit.

          A container view only has a single content view.  The content view
          is automatically added as a subview of the container view.

          Additional decorative subviews may be added via `addSubview()`, but
          their layout will not be automatically managed by `UIContainerView`.

          padding from the containers edges to the subview's edges.

                  The content view will be sized to its `intrinsicSize`, if it
                  has one, limited to the container size subtracting insets.

                  If the content view does not have an intrinsic size in a
                  direction, the container will call `sizeToFitSize()` with 
                  a maximum size determined by the smaller of container size
                  minus insets and `maximumContentSize`.

          While the container view will attempt to use the content view's
          `intrinsicSize`, and will always size the content view no
          larger than the container size minus `contentInsets`, you
          can use `maximumContentSize` to set an additional limit on the
          content.

          Width or height values of `0`() indicate no limit.
