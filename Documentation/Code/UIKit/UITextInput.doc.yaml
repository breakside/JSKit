summary: An interface for any text editing control to implement
description: |
  The low level text input manager will recognize input events and translate
  them into method calls on the `firstResponder` if that responder implements
  this `UITextInput` interface.

  All methods are optional.

        name: insertText
        summary: Insert the given text
        arguments:
          -
            name: text
            type: String
            summary: The text to insert
        description: |
          Typical implementations will insert the text at their current
          insertion point, replacing any selections with the text.

        name: insertNewline
        summary: Insert a newline, or otherwise handle an `Enter`() keypress
        description: |
          Implementations can treat a newline request as an `Enter`() key press,
          which may result in some action other than a newline insertion.
      -
        name: insertTab
        summary: Insert a horizontal tab, or otherwise handle a `Tab`() keypress
        description: |
          Implementations can treat a tab request as an `Tab` key press,
          which may result in some action other than a newline insertion.

          For example, `UITextField` treats a tab as an indication to
          have the window make its `nextKeyView` the `firstResponder`.

          Other implementations may treat a tab as an indentation request
      -
        name: insertBacktab
        summary: Insert a backtab, or otherwise handle a `Shift+Tab`() keypress
        description: |
          Implementations can treat a tab request as an `Shift+Tab` key press,
          which may result in some action other than a newline insertion.

          For example, `UITextField` treats a tab as an indication to
          have the window make its `previousKeyView` the `firstResponder`.

          Other implementations may treat a backtab as an outdentation request
