summary: An interface for any text editing control to implement
description: |
  The low level text input manager will recognize input events and translate
  them into method calls on the `firstResponder` if that responder implements
  this `UITextInput` interface.

  All methods are optional.

          Implementations can treat a tab request as an `Tab` key press,

          For example, `UITextField` treats a tab as an indication to
          have the window make its `nextKeyView` the `firstResponder`.

          Other implementations may treat a tab as an indentation request

        name: setMarkedText
        introduced: 2021.13.0
        summary: Insert the given text as marked text
        description: |
          Marked text is used when an input method composes the text to be
          inserted in multiple steps.

          For example, on macOS you can type `Option`()+`e`(), which inserts
          a marked accent, and then type a vowel like `a`(), resulting in
          an single `á`() character.

          This sequence is typically sent to a `UITextInput`() client as:

          - `setMarkedText("´")`
          - `clearMarkedText()`
          - `insertText("á")`

          `setMarkedText()` maybe called multiple times as the input composition
          progresses.  Each invocation should replace the current marked text with the
          new marked text and update the `markedTextRange()`.

        name: clearMarkedText

        summary: Clear the marked text to prepare for inserted text

          inserted in multiple steps.

          For example, on macOS you can type `Option`()+`e`(), which inserts
          a marked accent, and then type a vowel like `a`(), resulting in

          - `setMarkedText("´")`
          - `clearMarkedText()`
          - `insertText("á")`

          `clearMarkedText()` is called to indicate that the input composition
          is complete.  The current marked text should be removed and the
          `markedTextRange()` cleared.

        name: markedTextRange

          - `clearMarkedText()`
          - `insertText("á")`

          `markedTextRange()` should always return the range of marked text,
          which should be the range of the text added in `setMarkedText()`.
