  Gesture recognizers can be attached to views via `addGestureRecognizer()`(UIView.addGestureRecognizer).

  Recognizers allow for reuse of gesture code that can be used with any view.

  Standard subclasses include:
  - `UITapGestureRecognizer`

  ====

  To make your own gesture recognizer, implement
  - `touchesBegan()`
  - `touchesEnded()`
  - `touchesMoved()`
  - `touchesCanceled()`

  Updating `state` as appropriate for your recognizer

        summary: The state of the gesture recognizer
        description: |
          The recognizer's action fires each time the state changes, so
          the handler must check the state to determine the appropriate behavior.

          Typically, your action callback will only perform an action if the
          `state` is `recognized`
