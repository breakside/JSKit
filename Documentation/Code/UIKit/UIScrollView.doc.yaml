  While any `UIView` can scroll by adjusting its `bounds` origin, a
  `UIScrollView` provides convenient properties and methods that handle
  common scrolling behaviors and situations.

  `UIScrollView` also provides controls in the form of `UIScroller`s for the
  user to scroll with.

                  Typically, you don't need to specify a speical `contentView`,
                  and can instead simply specify `subviews` that will be
                  added to the scroll view's automatically-created
                  `contentView`(UIScrollView.contentView).
