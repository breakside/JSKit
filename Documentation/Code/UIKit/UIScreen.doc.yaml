        summary: The screen's frame
        description: |
          Defines the screen's origin and size.

          For a single screen application, the screen's origin is
          `JSPoint.Zero`, and the only useful information is the frame's size.

          The window manager uses the screen size to determine where windows
          can be placed.

        name: scale
        type: Number
        summary: The device pixel ratio of the screen
        description: |
          High resolution screens will have values greater than `1`.

          For example, a value of `2` indicates that each display system
          coordinate unit maps to 2 device pixels.

          Objects such as `JSImage` use the screen's scale to determine whether
          high resolution images should be loaded.
