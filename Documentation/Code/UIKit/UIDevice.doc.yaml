summary: Provides information about the characteristics of the device on which
  the application is running
description: |
  Since web applications can run on any kind of device,
  there are situations where it is helpful to the user if `UIKit` can
  provide a behavior tuned to the device they're using.

  For example, `UIKit` can display different UI elements for touch devices
  compared to mouse devices.

  `UIDevice` understands these differences provides
  an API for calling code do what's right for the device.

        type: UIUserInterface.PointerType
        summary: The primary method for pointer based input
        description: |
          Helps distinguish between devices that are primarily
          `touch`(UIUserInterface.PointerType.touch)-based like a phone and
          devices that are primarily
          `cursor`(UIUserInterface.PointerType.cursor)-based like a desktop or
          laptop.

        name: primaryPointerAccuracy
        type: UIUserInterface.PointerAccuracy
        summary: The accuracy of the primary pointer based input
        description: |
          A `cursor`(UIUserInterface.PointerType.cursor) based
          `primaryPointerType` always has
          `fine`(UIUserInterface.PointerAccuracy.fine) accuracy, whereas a touch
          device may be `fine`(UIUserInterface.PointerAccuracy.fine) or
          `coarse`(UIUserInterface.PointerAccuracy.coarse) depending on if
          the touch is pen or finger based.

        type: boolean
        summary: Indicates if the device is capable of touch input
        description: |
          Some devices have a `primaryPointerType` that isn't touch-based, but
          do accept touch as a secondary input method.
