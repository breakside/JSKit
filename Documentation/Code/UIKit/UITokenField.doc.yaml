summary: A text field that turns input into tokens that act like single
  characters
description: |
  A common example of token fields is the To field in an email compose window,
  where an address you've typed turns into a little bubble that acts like
  it is only one character big.

  Strings typed by the user get converted into data objects, which are shown
  in the field as tokens.

                  The data object for a string is what will be used to
                  create a token view with
                  `tokenFieldViewForRepresentedObject()`.

                  It can be whatever is meaningful to the `delegate`.

                  For an email To field, the represented object may be
                  a `Contact`() record.

                  The view will replace a string in the field, and will act
                  like a single character.
                note: If unimplemented, the token field will create a generic
                  token view using `tokenFieldStringForRepresentedObject()`
