  A `UIColorPanel` is a color picker popup window, typically opened by a
  `UIColorWell`.

  The standard color panel uses a `UIColorPanelViewController` for its window
  contents.  You can use `UIColorPanelViewController` independently from
  `UIColorPanel` if you require a custom window or embedding.
