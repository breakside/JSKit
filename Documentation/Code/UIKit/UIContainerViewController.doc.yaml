summary: A view controller that embeds a single child view controller
description: |
  A `UIContainerViewController` is a simple view controller that manages a
  single child view controller, embedding the child's view in a `UIContainerView`.

  The primary advantage of using a `UIContainerViewController` is its management
  of the child view controller, providing an ability to swap one child for
  another similiar to a `UITabViewController` without a tab interface or a
  pre-set list of possible child view controllers.

  Additionally, since the `UIContainerViewController`'s view is a `UIContainerView`,
  you can also take advantage of the layout features provided by `UIContainerView`.
