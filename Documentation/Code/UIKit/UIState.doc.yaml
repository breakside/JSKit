summary: An application state identifier, similar to a URL
description: |
  A `UIState` is a URL-like object that corresponds to a particular screen
  within an application.

  Unlike an actual URL, `UIState` only includes a path.

  Typically, you'll inspect the `state`(UIApplication.state) of the application
  during `applicationDidFinishLaunching()` to set the inital screen, then
  listen for external updates via `applicationDidRequestState()`.

  You'll also set `UIApplication.state` as your screens change.

  In an HTML based application, the current application state is reflected in
  the fragment part of the page's URL.

          It can often be helpful to inspect the path components one by one,
          using each component to show the next screen in a view hierarchy.

          The first component is always `/`.
