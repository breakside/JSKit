summary: A list view than can expand and collapse indented tree structures
description: |
  `UIListView` shows a flat list of items, perhaps with one level of grouping
  into sections.

  By contrast, `UIOutlineView` can display a tree structure of arbitrary depth,
  allowing the user to expand or collapse any node with children.

  An outline view is ideal for displaying a folder hierarchy of files and
  subfolders.

  Populating an Outline View
  ========

  An outline view works similarly to a `UIListView`.  It has a `delegate` and
  a `dataSource`.  In fact, because a `UIOutlineView` is a `UIListView`, its
  `delegate` is a `UIListViewDelegate` with a few additional methods.

  However, the outline view's `dataSource` is a bit different from a list view's
  due to the differences between a flat data structure and a tree structure.

  An outline view data soruce needs to know:

  - `numberOfSectionsInOutlineView()`
  - `outlineViewIsExandableAtIndexPath()`
  - `outlineViewNumberOfChildrenAtIndexPath()`

  Use of Index Paths
  =======

  An outline view uses `JSIndexPath`s to represent rows, just like a
  `UIListView`.

  However, where a list view contains index paths that always have two
  components (`section`(JSIndexPath.section) and `row`(JSIndexPath.row)), an
  outline view utilizes index paths with two *or more* components depending
  on how deep in the tree we are.
