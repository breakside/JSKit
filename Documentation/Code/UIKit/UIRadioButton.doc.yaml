          get a radio button that shares a look, but not colors, with the `UIKit`
          default.

        type: UIRadioButtonStyler
        summary: The styler used for this radio button
        description: |
          Stylers allow for separation between the radio button's model and its
          presentation.

          One styler can be resused for many radio buttons,
          reducing the need to subclass `UIRadioButton` just to apply a
          custom style.
