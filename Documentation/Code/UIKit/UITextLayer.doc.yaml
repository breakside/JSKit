summary: A layer displays text
descriptions: |
  This low level text layer is what `UILabel` uses to draw its text.

  Most of the time, `UILabel` is what you' should use, but in cases where the
  event overhead of a `UIView` is too much, and you just need text,
  `UITextLayer` could be appropriate.
