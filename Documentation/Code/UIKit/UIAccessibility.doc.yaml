        name: isAccessibilityElement
        kind: property
        type: boolean
        summary: Indicates if the item is in the accessibility element tree
        description: |
          `UIView`, for example, defaults this property to `false`, but allows
          subclasses such as `UIButton` or `UITextField` to override.

          The result is an accessibility element tree that is greatly simplified
          from the entire view tree, keeping only those views that are relevant
          in an accessibility context.

        name: accessibilityHidden
        kind: property
        type: boolean
        summary: Keeps an element in the accessibility tree, but indicates the
          element is visibly hidden
        description: |
          Useful for reporting what is visible to the user without removing
          something from the accessibility tree entirely.

        name: accessibilityLayer
        kind: property
        type: UILayer
        nullable: true
        summary: Provides the drawn layer that represents this accessibility element
        description: |
          For `UIView`, the accessibility layer is typically the view's own layer.

          Non-view elements, such as a `UIMenu`, are typically still drawn on the
          screen in some manner even though they aren't `UIView`s themselves.  In
          these cases, the accessibility layer points to the on-screen layer that
          represents the menu or other element.
        note: |
          You won't typically need to override this property.

        kind: property
        type: Role
        nullable: true
        summary: The primary role for this element
        description: |
          The accessibility system has a preset list of roles
          that it knows how to describe to users.

          Standard `UIKit` controls set their role automatically,
          but you may need to set a role for custom views that
          perform a standard accessibility role.

          When the primary role isn't enough to describe the kind
          of element, use `accessibilitySubrole` to provide more detail.
      -
        name: accessibilitySubrole
        kind: property
        type: Subrole
        nullable: true
        summary: The secondary role for this element, if any
        description: |
          Sometimes a secondary role helps clarify the type of
          element beyond its general primary `accessibilityRole`.

          For example, a tab control is essentially a `button`(UIAccessibility.Role.button),
          but it's a specific kind of button: a `tab`(UIAccessibility.Subrole.tab).
