summary: A group of `UIRadioButton`s
description: |
  Radio buttons are grouped into a `UIRadioGroup` to indicate which sets of
  buttons are mutually exclusive.

  Radio buttons are used when the user can select one out of many options.

  It is an alternative interface to a `UIPopupButton`.

                summary: The line height to use for calculating spacing between
                  buttons
                description: |
                  Line height is specified as a percentage of a button's
                  intrinsic size.

                  Therefore, it is typically a number greater than `1`.

                  For example, if buttons are 20px tall and `lineHeight` is
                  `1.5`, the distance between consecutive button tops will
                  be `20px * 1.5 = 30px`.  The spacing between items is `10px`.

        summary: The styler `UIKit` uses by default
        description: |
          `UIRadioGroup` creates a default styler instance using its own colors, but
          you can always create your own instance and override the colors to
          get a radio button that shares a look, but not colors, with the `UIKit`
          default.

          This styler simply uses the `UIRadioButton.Styler.default`(UIRadioButton.Styler)
          for its `buttonStyler`.

        summary: The styler used for this radio group
        description: |
          Stylers allow for separation between the radio groups's model and its
          presentation.

          One styler can be resused for many radio groups,
          reducing the need to subclass `UIRadioGroup` just to apply a
          custom style.
