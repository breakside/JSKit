        summary: The styler `UIKit` uses by default
        description: |
          `UIScroller` creates a default styler instance using its own colors, but
          you can always create your own instance and override the colors to
          get a scroller that shares a look, but not colors, with the `UIKit`
          default.

          The default scroller floats over the content and is invisible
          until the user scrolls.

          When scrolling the scroller is in a collapsed state that shows
          a mimimal indicator.

          If the user moves over the collapsed scroller, it expands into
          a larger control that the user can interact with.

        summary: The styler used for this scroller
        description: |
          Stylers allow for separation between the scroller's model and its
          presentation.

          One styler can be resused for many scrollers,
          reducing the need to subclass `UIScroller` just to apply a
          custom style.
