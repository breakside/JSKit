summary: A URL sesssion task for uploading data
description: |
  An upload task is functionally identical to a `JSURLSessionDataTask`, but
  is created with the `JSURLSession.uploadTaskWithRequest()` as a convenience.

  It's possible that future versions will differentiate this upload task from
  a regular data task.

  Also see `JSURLSessionTask` for properties and methods defined on the base
  task class that apply here.
