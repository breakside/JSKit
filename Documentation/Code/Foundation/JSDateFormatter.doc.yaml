summary: Utility for highly customizable date formatting
description: |
  Based on the [Unicode Date Formatting](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-31/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns)
  standard, this class formats dates according to date patterns.

  Using a formatter object allows code like a `UIViewController` to create the
  formatter once, and use it over and over again on dates that need formatting.

  Since the formatter carries information like a `locale`, `calendar` and labels,
  it's much more convenient to create once than to pass all of those parameters
  around when formatting dates.
note: |
  While all of the common format specifiers are implemented, `JSDateFormatter`
  has not yet implemented the following less common aspects of the Unicode
  standard:

  - Missing `Y` - Year in "Week of Year"
  - Missing `u` - Extended Year
  - Missing `U` - Cylic Year Name
  - Missing `Q` - Quarter
  - Missing `q` - Standalone Quarter
  - Missing `w` - Week of Year
  - Missing `W` - Week of Month
  - Missing `F` - Day of Week in Month
  - Missing `g` - Modified Julian day
  - Missing `j` - template hour
  - Missing `A` - milliseconds in day
  - Missing `Z.4` - Full Timezone name
  - Missing `v`, `V`, `x`, and `X` - Various timezone labels

          By default, the formatter will use whichever calendar is specified
          by `locale`.

          Setting this property will override that locale-based behavior.
