summary: A two-dimensional size with `width` and `height`, useful for graphics
  and user interface elements
description: |
  `JSSize` is a building block for various graphics-related tasks.  Along with
  `JSPoint`, it can define a rectangle like `JSRect`.

  `UIKit` makes extensive use of `JSSize` in view sizing, text layout, and other
  UI elements.

  Every `JSImage` has a width and height specified via a `JSSize` object.

          Sizes should be copied anytime before making modifications if the
          original size should remain the same.

          For exmaple, a function might make a copy of a passed argument before
          modifying it:

          ````
          function constrainedSize(size){
            size = JSSize(size);
            if (size.width > 100){
              // Since we're modifying the size here, but only want to affect
              // the return value, we need to first do a copy of the size
              size.width = 100;
            }
            if (size.height > 100){
              size.height = 100;
            }
            return size;
          }
          ````
        return: A new size that is an exact copy of the other
        type: JSSize
        arguments:
          -
            name: other
            type: JSSize
            summary: The size to copy
      -
        kind: property
        static: true
        name: Zero
        type: JSSize
        summary: A size with width and height components set to 0
        description: |
          A shortcut for
          ````
          JSSize(0, 0)
          ````
          that can be used as a default starting point or as a comparison as in:
          ````
          var size = sizeFromSomewhere();
          if (size.isEqual(JSSize.Zero)){
            // 
          }else{
            // 
          }
          ````
        note: Even though this looks like a property, it will always return a
          new `JSSize` each time it is invoked, ensuring that nothing can
          accidentally modify or overwrite the `Zero` property.
