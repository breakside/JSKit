          programmed in the init call by dividing each number by `255`

        summary: Description of properties that can be included in a spec file
        description: |
          A `JSColor` can be specified in a few different ways:

          1. As a string corresponding to the name of a static `JSColor` property
          1. As an RGBA color with the `rgba` property
          1. As a grayscale color with the `white` property
          1. With a `space` property and other properties corresponding to component names
          1. As a blending of colors with the `blendBase`, `with`, and `percent`
             properties.

          Implicit Class
          --------------
          In most cases, colors in spec files do not need to include the
          `class` property because their parent object will know to
          instantiate a `JSColor`.

          For example, a `UIView` knows to make its `backgroundColor` a
          `JSColor`, so `class` is unecessary.

          ````
          MainView:
            class: UIView
            backgroundColor:
              rgba: 245,245,250,0.6
            borderColor:
              rgba: #36A3FA

            members:
              -
                name: rgba
                type: String
                summary: A comma-separated list of r,g,b,a components, or a hex string
                description: |
                  Creates a color in the RGBA color space with the given
                  components.  Any missing color components default to `0`,
                  while a missing `alpha` component defaults to `1`.

                  ````
                  ErrorColor:
                    class: JSColor
                    rgba: 204,24,0
                  ````

                  The `alpha` component is always specified using a decimal:

                  ````
                  ErrorColor:
                    class: JSColor
                    rgba: 204,24,0,0.8
                  ````

                  A hex format is also supported:

                  ````
                  ErrorColor:
                    class: JSColor
                    rgba: #CC1800
                  ````

                note: Color components in the spec file are written as integers
                  between `0` and `255`, in contrast to how components are
                  specified in Javascript code between `0.0` and `1.0`.

                  This is intentional to make spec programming more familar
                  to CSS programming.

                  In the following example, the `ui`(JSColorSpace.ui) color space is a
                  named color space, so it has a single component named `"name"`.
                  Colors from every space can additionally use the `"alpha"`
                  component.

          The color is first converted to RGB if necessary.

          If the alpha component is `1.0`(), the hex string is 6 characters
          long, representing the R, G, and B components.  Otherwise, the
          string is 8 charaters long and includes the alpha component.

          When reading from the pasteboard, you can use `initFromDictionary()`
          to construct a `JSColor` instance.
