        summary: Create a gradient with alternating positions and colors
        description: |
          Any number of colors can be specified simply by adding another
          two arguments to the call.

          A traditional two-color gradient might look like:
          ````
          var color1 = JSColor.red;
          var color2 = JSColor.blue;
          var gradient = JSGradient.initWithStops(0, color1, 1, color2);
          ````

          A three color gradient could be:
          ````
          var color1 = JSColor.black;
          var color2 = JSColor.red;
          var color2 = JSColor.blue;
          var gradient = JSGradient.initWithStops(0, color1, 0.2, color2, 0.7, color3);
          ````
        arguments:
          -
            name: position1
            type: Number
            summary: The percentage position between `start` and `end` for the
              first color
          -
            name: color1
            type: JSColor
            summary: The color at the first position

        name: gradientBetweenColors
        kind: method
        static: true
        type: JSGradient
        summary: Create a two-color gradient from positions `0` to `1`
        arguments:
          -
            name: color1
            type: JSColor
            summary: The first color
          -
            name: color2
            type: JSColor
            summary: The second color
        description: |
          ````
          var gradient = JSGradient.gradientBetweenColors(JSColor.red, JSColor.blue);
          ````

          is the same as

          ````
          var gradient = JSGradient.initWithStops(0, JSColor.red, 1, JSColor.blue);
          ````

        kind: spec
        summary: Description of properties that can be included in a spec file
        description: |
          For simple gradients a shortcut spec format is allowed.  The stop
          positions are `0` and `1` for the two colors.

          ````
          MainView:
            class: UIView
            backgroundGradient:
              from: red
              to: blue
          ````

          Is equivalent to:

          ````
          var view = UIView.init();
          view.backgroundGradient = JSGradient.gradientBetweenColors(JSColor.red, JSColor.blue);
          ````

          For more advanced gradients, you can specify an array of alternating
          stop positions and colors:

          ````
          MainView:
            class: UIView
            backgroundGradient:
              stops: [0%, red, 10%, blue, 80%, {rgba: 102,102,204}]
          ````
