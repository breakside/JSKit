  A `JSTextFrame` is the result of calling `JSTextFramesetter.createFrame()`,
  and contains a list of `JSTextLine`s, which in turn contain lists of
  `JSTextRun`s.

  Typically after creating a text frame, you draw it to a graphics context
  via `drawInContextAtPoint()`.

  The text framesetting process enables rich text layout in a graphics context.
