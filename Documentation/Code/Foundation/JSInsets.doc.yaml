summary: A set of numbers that specify insets from edges of a rectangle
description: |
  Insets can be used to specify padding-like values and calculate a rectangle
  that is inside another rectangle, offset from the each edge by the
  corresponding `JSInsets` property.

          A shortcut for
          ````
          JSInsets(0)
          ````
          that can be used as a default starting point or as a comparison as in:
          ````
          var insets = insetsFromSomewhere();
          if (insets.isEqual(JSInsets.Zero)){
            // 
          }else{
            // 
          }
          ````
        note: Even though this looks like a property, it will always return a
          new `JSInsets` each time it is invoked, ensuring that nothing can
          accidentally modify or overwrite the `Zero` property.
