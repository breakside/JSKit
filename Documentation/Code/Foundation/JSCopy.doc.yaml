    summary: The object or array to copy
description: |
  A shallow copy of an array or object allows you to modify which elements are
  in the copy without modifying the original object.

  The elements themselves will not be copied.  Therefore, changing an element's
  property in the copy will change the element in the original becuase they are
  the exact same element.
  
  If you need a recursive copy that also copies the elements, see
  `JSDeepCopy()`.
important: |
  `JSCopy` only works with primitive javascript values.  If you try to
  copy a `JSObject`, the copy will not function as expected.
