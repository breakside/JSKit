summary: The abstract base class for `JSURLSession` tasks
description: |
  `JSURLSession` can create tasks for HTTP requests like a
  `JSURLSessionDataTask`, `JSURLSessionUploadTask`, or a
  `JSURLSessionStreamTask`.

  This class is the base class for all of those concrete subclasses.

          reject:
            type: Error
            summary: An error that occurred during the request
        return: If you provided a callback when creating the task from a
          `JSURLSession`, that callback will be invoked when the request
          completes or errors out, and nothing will be returned here.
          Otherwise, a `Promise` will be returned as a way of monitoring task
          completion.
        summary: Start the task
        description: |
          After a task is created, you must call `resume()` in order to start
          the actual HTTP request.

          This gives you an opportunity to set any task delgate before starting.
