        summary: Import time zone data
        description: |
          By default, `JSTimeZone` doesn't know about any time zones.

          Time zone data is specified by a data structure that can grow quite
          large if all time zones are included, so `JSTimeZone` allows you
          to pick and choose which time zones are truly important for your
          application.

          Therefore, the first thing your application needs to do is import
          the time zone data you selected.
        arguments:
          -
            name: info

        summary: Create a time zone based on its identifier string
        return: \`null` if zone for the given identifier is not found
        description: |
          Time zones are represented by identifier strings such as
          `"America/Los_Angeles"`.

          The supported list of time zones depends on what data was initially
          imported via `importZoneInfo()`.
        arguments:
          -
            name: identifier

        description: |
          While it is almost always better to use a named time zone because it
          accounts for daylight savings and historical changes, you may on
          occasion need a time zone with a fixed offset from UTC no matter what.

            name: timeInterval

        description: |
          The local time zone defaults to using the `systemTimeZoneIdentifier`,
          which is automatically chosen by the platform when the application
          initializes.

          You can override the default choice by calling `changeLocalTimeZone()`
        see:
          - changeLocalTimeZone
          - systemTimeZoneIdentifier

          Changing the local time zone effectively change the value of the
          `local` property.
