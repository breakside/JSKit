summary: An SHA1 hash function
description: |
  SHA1 hashes can be used for calculating sums for non-security related purposes,
  like comparing two files or creating unique identifiers.

  Compared to the `SecurityKit` framework, this hash function here can be called
  without an asynchronous interface.  However, the SHA1 algorithm is
  not considered secure.

  This `JSSHA1Hash` function should only be used for identity hashing and checking,
  which is often a convenient way to create `id` values for objects, but does
  not require security.

  For example, when a `UIApplication` is created for the web, a bundle of
  resources (like images) is created and each resource is given a filename based
  on the `SHA1` hash of its contents.  This ensures unique names for each
  resource, and provides easy cache-busting if a resource changes.  At no point
  are the resource names required for security.
important: If you are hashing data for secure purposes, then use the `SECHash`
  class from the `SecurityKit` framework.  The `SHA1` hash function is not
  secure.

        description: |
          After creating a hasher, you can `add()` as many cunks of data
          as you want before calling `finish()`.

          ````
          var chunks = [ ... ];
          var sha1 = new JSSHA1Hash();
          for (var i = 0, l = chunks.length; i < l; ++i){
            sha1.add(chunks[i]);
          }
          sha1.finish();
          var hex = sha1.digest().hexStringRepresentation();
          ````
        important: This constructor must be invoked with `new`().

        description: |
          You'll typically call `digest()` after calling `finish()`, in order
          to get the result of the hash.

        summary: Get the result of hashing all the data chunks
        note: |
          You can call `hexStringRepresentation()` on the result to generate
          a string form of the SHA1 hash.
