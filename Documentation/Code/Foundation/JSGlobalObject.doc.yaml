summary: A platform-independent reference to the Javascript global object
description: |
  In a browser context, the global object is called `window`().

  In a node.js context, the global object is called `global`().

  This `JSGlobalObject` variable is an alias for either, depending on which
  plaform an application is running.  It allows code to be written that works
  on either platform without modification.
