kind: protocol
introduced: "1.0.0"
summary: A delegate protocol for a `JSURLSession` to handle various session
  events.
description: |
  A url session delegate can be used instead of task-based callbacks or
  promises.
important: Session-level delegation is not recommend if you have more than a
  handful of tasks to deal with.  Use task callbacks or promises instead.
