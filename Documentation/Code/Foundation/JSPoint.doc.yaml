summary: A two-dimensional coordinate with `x` and `y` values, useful for graphics
  and user interface elements
description: |
  `JSPoint` is a building block for various graphics-related tasks.  Along with
  `JSRect`, it can define a rectangle like `JSRect`.

  `UIKit` makes extensive use of `JSPoint` in view positioning, text layout, and other
  UI elements.

        description: |
          Points should be copied anytime before making modifications if the
          original point should remain the same.

          For exmaple, a function might make a copy of a passed argument before
          modifying it:

          ````
          function constrainedPoint(point){
            point = JSPoint(point);
            if (point.x < 0){
              // Since we're modifying the point here, but only want to affect
              // the return value, we need to first do a copy of the point
              point.x = 0;
            }
            if (point.y < 0){
              point.y = 0;
            }
            return point;
          }
          ````
        return: A new point that is an exact copy of the other
        type: JSPoint
        arguments:
          -
            name: other
            type: JSPoint
            summary: The point to copy
      -
        kind: property
        static: true
        name: Zero
        type: JSPoint
        summary: A point with x and y components set to 0
        description: |
          A shortcut for
          ````
          JSPoint(0, 0)
          ````
          that can be used as a default starting point or as a comparison as in:
          ````
          var point = pointFromSomewhere();
          if (point.isEqual(JSPoint.Zero)){
            // 
          }else{
            // 
          }
          ````
        note: Even though this looks like a property, it will always return a
          new `JSPoint` each time it is invoked, ensuring that nothing can
          accidentally modify or overwrite the `Zero` property.

          ````
          var view = UIView.init()
          view.anchorPoint = JSPoint.UnitCenter;
