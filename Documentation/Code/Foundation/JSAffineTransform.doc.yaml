summary: A matrix transform for scaling, rotating, and translating coordinate
  systems
description: |
  An [affine transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) is
  used in 2D graphics to perform scaling, rotation, and tranlation operations.

  The data structure consists of six numeric components that correspond to
  six entries in a 3x3 matrix (the other 3 matrix entries never change).

          Transforms should be copied anytime before making modifications if the
          original transform should remain the unmodified.

          For exmaple, a function might make a copy of a passed argument before
          modifying it.

        type: JSAffineTransform

          ````
          var transform = transformFromSomewhere();
          if (transform.isEqual(JSRect.Identity)){
            // 
          }else{
            // 
          }
          ````
        note: Even though this looks like a property, it will always return a
          new `JSAffineTransform` each time it is invoked, ensuring that nothing
          can accidentally modify or overwrite the `Identity` property.
