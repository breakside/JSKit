summary: Add tasks to the main application run loop
description: |
  Javascript applications have an internal "run loop" that is constantly
  checking for events and executing code.

  Sometimes it's helpful to execute code not immediately, but on the next
  iteration of the run loop.

  Rather than set a short timeout, run loop exection is clearer in intent and
  faster in execution.
important: |
  `JSRunLoop` is not suitable for long-running tasks because they will
  block the application's main thread, like UI drawing.  Use `Dispatch`
  instead for expensive tasks.

        description: |
          The main run loop is always available and represents the main
          execution thread of the application.

          For UI applications, it is the same thread that draws the UI.
