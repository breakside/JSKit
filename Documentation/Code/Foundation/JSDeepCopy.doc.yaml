    summary: The object or array to copy
description: |
  A deep copy of an array or object will not just make a new collection, but
  will recursively copy each element in the collection.

  Therefore, changing an element's property in the copy will not affect the
  element in the original becuase they are not the exact same element.

  A deep copy can be expensive if the collection is large.  Use only when
  absolutely necessary.
  
  If you need a copy that doesn't copy the elements, see `JSCopy()`.
important: |
  `JSDeepCopy` only works with primitive javascript values.  If you try to
  copy a `JSObject`, the copy will not function as expected.
