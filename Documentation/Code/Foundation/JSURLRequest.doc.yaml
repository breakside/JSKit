summary: An HTTP request
description: |
  HTTP requests are a combination of a `url`, a `method`, any number of
  `headers`, and a `body`

  A request object defines how a request should be made, and is typically
  passed to `JSURLSession` to create a task that actually makes the request.

  Once a request a made and successfully contacts the server, a `response`
  property includes a `JSURLResponse` instance that contains all of the
  information releated to the server's response.
