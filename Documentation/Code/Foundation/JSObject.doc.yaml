        name: initWithSpec
        kind: init
        summary: Initialize an object with the values extracted from part of\
          a spec file
        description: |
          A spec is a declarative dictionary of properties that describe how
          an object should be initialized.

          Typically a subclass will implement its own version of this method
          to initialize properties from the spec, but first calling
          `$super.initWithSpec`.

          A simple example is:

          ````
          JSClass("MyObject", JSObject, {

            myProperty: 0

            initWithSpec: function(spec, values){
              MyObject.$super.initWithSpec.call(this, spec, values);
              this.myProperty = values.myProperty;
            }

          });
          ````

          However, some property initialization is more complex and requires
          using the spec to resolve more values.

          In this case, a color object is created.

          ````
          JSClass("MyObject", JSObject, {

            myColor: 0

            initWithSpec: function(spec, values){
              MyObject.$super.initWithSpec.call(this, spec, values);
              this.myColor = spec.resolveValue(values.myColor, "JSColor");
            }

          });
          ````

          See `JSSpec` for more details on what kind of values can be
          resolved.

        description: |
          While good class design generally leverages polymorphism so calling
          code doesn't need to distinguish between subclasses, in rare cases it
          can be useful to know exactly which kind of class an object is.

          In other cases, lack of argument overloading in JavaScript can be
          overcome by using dynamic type checking in a function to mimic the
          kind of overloading that is possible in other languages.
        note: |
          You can also use the `instanceof` operator to perform the same
          check, which can be convenient in situations where you don't even
          know if the arg is a `JSObject` with a `isKindOfClass` member to call.
