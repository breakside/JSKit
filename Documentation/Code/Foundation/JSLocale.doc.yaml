        summary: Create a locale based on a standard identifier
        description: |
          A locale identifier is typically a two letter language sequence like
          `"en"` followed by a region specifier like "`-US`", resulting in a
          string like `"en-US"`.

          Less commonly, an identifier has an additional 4 letter script code.
          And it can finally have any number of dash-separated extensions after
          a `"-u-"` sequence.
        note: Sometimes identifiers are specified with underscores instead of
          dashes, like `"en_US"`.  This init method will accept underscores in
          place of dashes.
