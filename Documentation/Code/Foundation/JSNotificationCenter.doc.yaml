summary: A hub for sending and receiving notifications throughout an application
description: |
  Components can post notifications to the notification center, which then
  distributes the notifications to any registered listeners.

  Most times, the `shared` notification center is place to post and listen
  for noficiations, but it's possible to create a private notification center
  if you need.
note: |
  For user-facing notifications, see `NotificationKit`
important: Notifications are sent immediately and synchronously.
