summary: Represents a font that can be used to draw text
description: |
  Fonts are used extensively throughout `Foundation`, `UIKit`, and other
  frameworks.

  A font is a combination of:

  1. A `descriptor`
  2. A `pointSize`

  Font Descriptors
  ================

  A font descriptor, represented by `JSFontDescriptor` is a combination of
  properties like:

  1. Family (e.g., Helvetica)
  1. Weight (e.g., Bold)
  1. Style (e.g., Italic)
  1. Metrics (e.g., ascender, descender)

  Font Resources
  ==============
  `JSKit` based apps require any referenced font to be bundled as a resource.

  This allows the build system to extract and bundle font metadata that is
  helpful for advanced text layout.

  Simply drop `.ttf` of `.otf` files in your project's folder, and they'll
  be inclued as resources.

  Once a font is bundled as a resource, it can be referenced by its family
  name and specific descriptor.

          Every `UIApplication` must register a system font using the
          `UIApplicationSystemFont` property in the application's [Info](UIApplicationInfo)
          file.
        note: Many controls use the stystem font as a default.
