summary: A compact representation of a possibly large collection of indexes.
description: |
  Tracking the selected items in a large list presents a challenge because
  while only some of the items may be loaded and vislble on screen, a selection
  can cover a potentially large number of the items.

  An index set holds a collection of ranges instead of a collection of indexes.
  The ranges in turn hold start and end values.

  For example, a selection set holding all items from a 10,000 item list simply
  holds one range: [0,10000].
