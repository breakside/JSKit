  use color spaces on their own to convert color components from data sources
  other than `JSColor`.

        summary: The number of components for colors in this space.
        note: When creating a `JSColor`, you'll always use `numberOfComponents + 1`
          components, where the final component represents the color's `alpha`(JSColor.alpha)
          value.
