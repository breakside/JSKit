summary: A color space that gives meanings to the components of a `JSColor`
description: |
  `JSColor.space` is the most common use of a color space, but you can also
  use color spaces on their own to convert color components from data sources
  other than `JSColor`.

          Available only if you import `UIKit`.

          Can be used to add or update named user interface colors, which
          simplifies implementation themes and of dark mode.
        note: |
          For convenience, when you add a new color to the `ui` space via `setColorForName()`, a static property
          of the same name will be automatically added to `JSColor`.  Thereafter, overwriting
          the static property on `JSColor` is equivalent to calling `setColorForName()` again.
        important: |
          When you update a `ui` color, either by calling `setColorForName()` or by
          overwriting its corresponding `JSColor` static property, the entire user
          interface will be re-rendered at the next display cycle

        summary: The number of components for colors in this space.
        note: When creating a `JSColor`, you'll always use `numberOfComponents + 1`
          components, where the final component represents the color's `alpha`(JSColor.alpha)
          value.
