  Designed for both server and browser environment, `JSFile` defines
  a common API for interacting with files that have been provided by
  platform-specific features like `UIOpenPanel`.

  In HTML, for example, a file open panel will provice a `JSFile` that is
  backed by the HTML Blob API.

          When sending a `JSFile` to a `UISavePanel`, the name provides
          a default name for the file.
