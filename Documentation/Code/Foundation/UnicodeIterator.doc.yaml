summary: A `String`-derivied iterator for unicode characters
description: |
  JavaScript strings are a sequence of UTF-16 codepoints, which typically, but
  not always, are equivalent to Unicode codepoints.  Sometimes a Unicode
  codepoint cannot be represented with 16 bytes, so UTF-16 uses a
  "surrogate pair" of two UTF-16 codepoints that represent a single Unicode
  codepoint.

  A `UnicodeIterator` is aware of these surrogate pairs and automatically
  combines & decodes them into a single unicode codepoint during iteration.

  ````
  var string = "Hello ðŸ˜€";

  // First, here's what the UTF-16 codepoints look like
  // This is the kind of character iteration that JavaScript
  // supports out of the box
  var utf16 = [];
  for (var i = 0, l = string.length; i < l; ++i){
    utf16.push(string.charCodeAt(i));
  }
  // utf16.length == 8
  // utf16 == [0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F, 0x20, 0xD83D, 0xDE00]


  // Next, here's what the unicode codepoints look like
  // This is the kind of character iteration that Foundation
  // makes possible
  var codepoints = [];
  for (var iterator = string.unicodeIterator(); iterator.character !== null; iterator.increment()){
    codepoints.push(iterator.character.code);
  }
  // codepoints.length == 7
  // codepoints == [0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F, 0x20, 0x1F600]

        summary: The character at the current iteration point
        important: This will be `null` if we have reached the end of iteration
        note: The value is a `UnicodeChar`, on which you'll need to access
          the `code` property to get the numeric codepoint.

        description: |
          For non surrogate pairs, `nextIndex` should be `index`` + 1`.  For
          surrogate pairs, `nextIndex` should be `index`` + 2`.
