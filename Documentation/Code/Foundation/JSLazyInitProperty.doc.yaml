summary: Create a property that is lazily created the first time it is accessed
description: |
  When defining a class with `JSClass()`, a dynamic getter property
  can be created using `JSLazyInitProperty()`.  But instead of always calling
  the getter on each access, the value is intialized only once on the first
  access, and that value is then set as the property going forward, eliminating
  the getter.

  ````
  JSClass("PersonView", UIView, {

    nameLabel: JSLazyInitProperty('_createNameLabel', '_nameLabel'),
    companyLabel: JSLazyInitProperty('_createCompanyLabel', '_companyLabel'),

    _createNameLabel: function(){
      return UILabel.init();
    },

    _createCompanyLabel: function(){
      return UILabel.init();
    },

    layoutSubviews: function(){
      if (this._nameLabel !== null){
        this._nameLabel.frame = JSRect(0, 0, this.bounds.size.width, 20);
      }
      if (this._companyLabel !== null){
        this._companyLabel.frame = JSRect(0, 20, this.bounds.size.width, 20);
      }
    }

  })
  ````

  In this example, a `PersonView` doesn't bother creating its subviews unless
  they're actually used by calling code.

  Alternatively, you can specify the property init method inline:

  ````
  JSClass("PersonView", UIView, {

    nameLabel: JSLazyInitProperty(function(){
      return UILabel.init();
    }),

    companyLabel: JSLazyInitProperty(function(){
      return UILabel.init();
    })

  })

          Setting a private property on value construction is helpful when you
          want to check if the lazy property value has been constructed.

          Without a private property, you'd only be able to access the public
          property, but doing so would construct the value and would be of
          no use in determining if the value has not yet been constructed.
