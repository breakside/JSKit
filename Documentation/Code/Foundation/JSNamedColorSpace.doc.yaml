summary: A color space that uses names to reference its colors
description: |
  A named color space contains a map from names to colors.  `JSColor`s with
  a named color space as their `space`(JSColor.space) have a single
  component, the name of the color to lookup in the space's map.

  `UIKit` makes use of a named color space for standard user interface colors,
  accessible via the `JSColorSpace.ui` static property.  A named space allows
  for a level of indirection, like a pointer, that is useful for changing
  interface colors dynamically.  A `UILabel` with a reference to `JSColor.text`,
  for example, can be updated simply by changing the color space's map for the
  `"text"` name, without any direct changes to the label itself.
