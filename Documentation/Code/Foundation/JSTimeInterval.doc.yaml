summary: Convenience methods for calculating the correct number of seconds for
  various intervals like minutes or hours.
description: |
  Throughout `JSKit`, various methods take a Number argument representing a
  time interval in seconds.

  To improve readability, clarity of intent, and to reduce calculation errors,
  `JSTimeInterval` provides a handful of methods that perform calculations.

  Anything larger than hours should be handled with `JSCalendar`, which correctly
  handles situtations such as daylight savings time switches where a day may
  not be 24 hours.
