  A [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_curve) is a mathematically
  defined curve from a starting point to and ending point with two control points
  that affect the curve's shape.

        type: JSPoint[]
        summary: A list of points that define the limits of the curve's shape
        note: The list always includes `p1` and `p1`, which may not be true
          bounding points.  Callers are expected to analyze all points to
          determine the ones that define a bounding rectangle.
