description: |
  `NotificationKit` provides functionality for applications to create and 
  display user-visible notifications in a platform-specific manner.

  For example, in a web-based `UIKit` application, user notifications will
  appear as desktop notifications.

  Posting such notifications typically requires an explicit grant of permission
  from the user.  Requests for such permission should be made when first
  relevant as opposed to when the app first runs.
