name: APIKit Info
introduced: 2021.8.0
kind: dictionary
summary: A file of api properties
description: |
  The api's `Info` file is a YAML or JSON dictionary that contains
  properties instructing the handler on how to initialize.

  The file should be named either `Info.yaml` or `Info.json` and placed at the
  root of the application's project.

  Among other things, the `Info` file
  - Indicates the api type
  - Uniquely identifies the api
  - Lists the api version
  - Points to the `APIResponder`
  - Lists possible `APISecrets`
topics:

        name: JSBundleType
        type: String
        summary: The type of project
        description: |
          Must be `api`
      -
        name: JSBundleIdentifier
        type: String
        summary: The globally unique identifier for the application
        description: |
          A bundle identifier should be globally unique, so the use of a
          reverse-domain syntax is strongly encouraged.

          For example, the identifier for this documentation viewer is
          ````
          io.breakside.JSKit.DocViewer
          ````
      -
        name: JSBundleVersion
        type: String
        summary: A series of dot-separated integers representing the
          applications current production version
        description: |
          The version number is used by the build system for such things as
          tagging the Docker image, so it's important to keep the number
          up to date when building production builds.

          While no exact convention is defined, we recommend using a
          Major.Minor.Bufix style version number.

        name: APIResponder
        type: String
        summary: The name of a class that should be instantiated as the
          \`APIResponder`(APIKit.APIResponder) subclass for handling the request
        description: |
          An api is required to have a responder that subclasses
          `APIResponder`(APIKit.APIResponder).

          When specified as a class name here, the api handler will
          instantiate an object of that class to act the responder.

          if none of the user's preferred languages are supported by the app.
