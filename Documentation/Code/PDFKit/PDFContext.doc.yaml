  A `PDFContext` provides a `JSContext` interface for drawing to a PDF document.

  Only a few extra methods are needed for dealing with PDF pages

                name: usePDFCoordinates
                type: boolean
                summary: Keep the standard PDF coordinates with the origin
                  in the bottom left and positive y values toward the top.
                description: |
                  Most `JSContext` drawing assumes coordinates that have an
                  origin in the top left with positive y values toward the
                  bottom.

                  If `usePDFCoordinates` isn't specified, `PDFConext` will
                  automatically flip the page coordinate to match the
                  `JSContext` default rather than the PDF default.
