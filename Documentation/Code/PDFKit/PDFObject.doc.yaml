summary: A base class for all PDF objects
description: |
  A `PDFObject` is anything found in a `PDFDocument`.  It does not inherit
  from `JSObject`, but instead defines its own simplified class root.

  While many types of objects are formally defined like `PDFPage` or `PDFImage`,
  this base `PDFObject` class can be used as a dictionary like object
  with arbitrary keys added.
