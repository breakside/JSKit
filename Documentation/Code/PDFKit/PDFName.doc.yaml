summary: A wrapper for named references in PDF documents
description: |
  PDF files contain named references that are represented internally
  by strings like `/Name`.

  A `PDFName` contains the text after the leading `/`.

  In most cases, it can be used like a `String`.
  - You can compare a `PDFName` to a string with `==`
  - You can use a `PDFName` as a dictionary key

        summary: Reinterpret the original value as a UTF-8 encoded string
        description: |
          By default, names are assumed to be in the `latin1`(String.Encoding.latin1`)
          encoding.

          Since names are rarely shown to users, the assumed encoding doesn't
          matter as long as it's consistent.

          For the few cases where a name needs to be shown to a user, the PDF
          specification indicates that it should be treated as UTF-8.

          You can call this method to reinterpret the name as a UTF-8 encoded
          string.
