summary: Read and write PDF files
description: |
  The goal of `PDFKit` is to support reading and parsing of PDF files in the
  browser or on a server in a common way.

  Additionaly, a `PDFContext` is provided to support `JSContext`-style drawing
  straight to a PDF, making it simple to duplicate what you've drawn on the
  screen to a PDF.
