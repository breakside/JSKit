summary: The properties associated with a particular PDF graphics state
description: |
  A `PDFGraphicsState` contains properties related to the current drawing
  options like fill color, line width, font, etc.

  As a `PDFOperationIterator` iterates through operations, it keeps an updated
  `state`(PDFOperationIterator.state) to reference as you handle the operations.
