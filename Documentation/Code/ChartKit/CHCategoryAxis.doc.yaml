summary: An axis that displays category labels
description: |
  A category axis is used by `CHCategoryChart` to draw an axis for the chart's
  categories, typically displayed as the x-axis.

  A category axis has user-supplied labels and never has minor tick marks.

  Depending on the context, a category axis may draw its labels at tick marks
  (like for a line chart) or between tick marks (like for a bar chart).
