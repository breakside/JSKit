summary: An abstract base class for an axis on a chart
description: |
  A chart's axis typically is drawn as a line along one edge of the chart
  and shows labels to help identify the data.

  This abstract base class provides common properties and functionality shared
  across all kinds of axes.

  Standard subclasses include:
  - `CHCategoryAxis`
  - `CHValueAxis`

  A `CHCategoryChart`, for example, contains one `CHCategoryAxis` and one
  `CHValueAxis`.

  Subclassing

  To make a custom axis type, you'll need to implement the following methods:

  - `getMajorPositions()`
  - `getMinorPositions()`
  - `getMajorLabels()`

      - name: initWithStyle
        kind: init
        summary: Create an axis with the given style

          While you can create an axis directly, charts typically create each
          axis they need on their own.  For example, `CHCategoryChart` creates
          its `valueAxis`(CHCategoryChart.valueAxis) and
          `categoryAxis`(CHCategoryChart.categoryAxis) in its init procedure.

          In such a case, you can simply modify the axis as necessary.
