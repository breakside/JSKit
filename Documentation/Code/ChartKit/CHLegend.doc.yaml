summary: Draws a legend on a chart
description: |
  A chart's legend is typically used to show names of each series next to a
  colored shape that can be used to match the name to an element in the chart.

  Most times, you'll only need to adjust the `placement` of a legend, but other
  options are available.

        description: |
          While you can create a legend directly, charts typically create their
          legend on their own.  For example, `CHCategoryChart` creates
          its `lege d`(CHCategoryChart.legend) in its init procedure.

          In such a case, you can simply modify the legend as necessary.
