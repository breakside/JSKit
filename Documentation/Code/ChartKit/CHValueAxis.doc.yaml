  A value axis is used by `CHCategoryChart` to draw an axis for the chart's
  values, typically displayed as the y-axis.

  A value axis shows a scale of values determined by options such as
  `minimumValue`, `maximumValue`, and `numberOfMajorSteps`.

           This determines the number of major tick marks and their values.

           Often you'll want to choose values for `minimumValue`,
           `maximumValue`, and `numberOfMajorSteps` that work well together
           to show useful values.  For example, if your scale is 0 to 100,
           you might want 10 major steps so the labels are 0, 10, 20, 30, etc.
           Or you might use 4 major steps to get 0, 25, 50, 75, 100.
