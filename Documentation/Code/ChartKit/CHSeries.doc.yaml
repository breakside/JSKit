summary: Represents a data series that can be shown on a chart
description: |
  Charts are required to have at least one data series, and often have more
  than one.

  Each series has a `name`, a set of `values`, and a `style`.

  While you can create a series directly, it's often easier to use the
  convenience methods such as `CHCategoryChart.addValues()` and
  `CHPieChart.setDataPoints()`, which automatically create series objects for
  you.

        summary: Push a value onto the value set for this series
        arguments:

            type: any
            summary: The value to add to this series

    members:
      - name: style
        type: CHSeriesStyle
        summary: The style for this series
        description: |
          `CHSeriesStyle` is an abstract class.  For any given chart type,
          the `style` for a series will be a instance of a `CHSeriesStyle`
          subclass appropriate for the chart.  For example, a `CHBarChart`
          series should have a `CHSeriesBarStyle` for its `series`.

          When using convenience methods such as `CHCategoryChart.addValues()`
          and `CHPieChart.setDataPoints()`, the series style is automatically
          created by the chart based on its theme.
