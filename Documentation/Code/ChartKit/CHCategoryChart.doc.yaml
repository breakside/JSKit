summary: An abscract class for charts that have a category axis and a value axis
description: |
  `CHCategoryChart` defines the key features of the common chart family that
  contain a category axis and a value axis.

  Standard subclass include:

  - `CHBarChart`
  - `CHStackedBarChart`
  - `CHLineChart`
  - `CHAreaChart`
  - `CHStackedAreaChart`

  Subclassing
  ----

  To create a custom `CHCategoryChart` subclass, you must implement the following
  methods and set the following properties:

  - `drawValuesInContext()`
  - `defaultSeriesStyle`
topics:
  - name: Axes
    members:
      - name: categoryAxis
        type: CHCategoryAxis
        summary: The axis for the category names
        description: |
          By default, this is the X-axis.  You can change the orientation
          of the chart by setting `valueDirection`.
        see:
          - valueAxis
          - valueDirection
          - addValues
      - name: valueAxis
        type: CHValueAxis
        summary: The axis for the data values
        description: |
          By default, this is the Y-axis.  You can change the orientation
          of the chart by setting `valueDirection`.
        see:
          - valueAxis
          - valueDirection
          - addValues
      - name: valueDirection
        type: CHAxis.Direction
        summary: Controls which direction the value axis is displayed
        description: |
          Defaults to `vertical`(CHAxis.Direction), which orients the value
          axis vertically on the chart's leading edge with the category axis
          horizontal on the chart's trailing edge.

          When set to `horizontal`(CHAxis.Direction), it orients the value
          axis horizontal on the chart's trailing edge with the category axis
          vertical on the chart's leading edge.
  - name: Legend & Layout
    members:
      - name: legend
        type: CHLegend
        summary: The legend for this chart
        description: |
          Use the legend's `placement`(CHLegend.placement) to control the
          legend's visibility and location.
      - name: chartInsets
        type: JSInsets
        summary: The amount to inset the chart from the edges of the requested
          drawing area
  - name: Data
    members:
      - name: addValues
        kind: method
        summary: Add a data series to the chart with the given values
        arguments:
          - name: values
            type: Number[]
            summary: The data values to add
          - name: name
            type: String
            summary: The series name
        description: |
          Creates a new series using
          - The given values
          - The given name
          - The style from `defaultSeriesStyle`
          - The color from `colorForSeriesAtIndex()`
      - name: defaultSeriesStyle
        type: CHSeriesStyle
        summary: The style to use for each new series created by `addValues()`
        description: |
          Subclasses must set this property, typically during `initWithTheme()`.

          For example, `CHBarChart` sets `defaultSeriesStyle` to the theme's
          `barStyle`(CHTheme).
  - name: Drawing
    members:
      - name: drawValuesInContext
        kind: method
        summary: Draw the values for the chart in the given area
        arguments:
          - name: context
            type: JSContext
            summary: The context in which to draw
          - name: rect
            type: JSRect
            summary: The area in which to draw values
        description: |
          Must be implemented by subclasses.

          Only for drawing the values area of the chart, such as the bars of a
          `CHBarChart` or the lines of a `CHLineChart`.  Everying else (legend,
          axes, etc.) are drawn by `CHCategoryChart`'s implementation of
          `drawInContext()`.
