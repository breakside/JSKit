summary: Simple hash functions
description: |
  A minimal set of simple hash functions that can be used synchronously for
  use cases where security is *not required*.

  Compared to the `SecurityKit` framework, the hash functions here can be called
  without an asynchronous interface.  However, the algoritms supported here are
  not considered secure.

  This `Hash` framework should only be used for identity hashing and checking,
  which is often a convenient way to create `id` values for objects, but does
  not require security.

  For example, when a `UIApplication` is created for the web, a bundle of
  resources (like images) is created and each resource is given a filename based
  on the `SHA1` hash of its contents.  This ensures unique names for each
  resource, and provides easy cache-busting if a resource changes.  At no point
  are the resource names required for security.
important: If you are hashing data for secure purposes, then use the `SECHash`
  class from the `SecurityKit` framework.  The `MD5` and `SHA1` hash functions
  are not secure.
