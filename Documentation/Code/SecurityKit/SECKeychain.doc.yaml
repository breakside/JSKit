summary: A secure client-side storage area for user secrets, only accessible via
  a user-chosen passphrase
description: |
  A keychain provides a way to store sensitive user credentials in the
  client so they never have to pass through your servers.

  The user can be confident that their passwords are not shared with
  anyone.

  The keychain can also be useful for end-to-end encryption scenarios
  where the client needs to generate secret encryption keys.

          If the keychain has not yet been setup with a master password,
          you'll need to get a password from the user and then call
          `initializeWithMasterPassword()`.

          If the keychain is already setup, you can call `unlock()`.
