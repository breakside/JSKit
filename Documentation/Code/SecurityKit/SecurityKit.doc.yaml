  `SecurityKit` provides a foundation for encryption, decryption, hashing,
  and verification.

  Server and client code can share the same encryption logic with a unified
  API across both platforms.

  In addition, it includes `SECKeychain` functionality for secure secret storage
  in the browser or on a server.

  `SecurityKit` also has support for commonly used technologies such as JSON
  Web Tokens via `SECJSONWebToken`.
